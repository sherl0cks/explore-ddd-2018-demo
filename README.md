# explore-ddd-2018-demo

This repo is a random collection of ideas that were used throughout the process to prepare for [my talk at Explore DDD 2018](http://exploreddd.com/speakers/justin-holmes.html).

In short:

- The actual demo used in the talk was stood up using the contents of the `bpm` directory. It has all necessary links.
- The `sales` directory was part of an abandoned approach to use a sales pipeline example. It has an actor model built with [vert.x](https://vertx.io/) which I'll keep here for posterity (but I would avoid in production in favor of more k8s approaches - feel free to ping me about that). The `delivery` directory was part of this iteration and never flushed out.
- The `cabit` directory is the first cut an idea to build a cab hailing demo app. That idea will be flushed out elsewhere.
